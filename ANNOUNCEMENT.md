# 🎉 Duo HTTP/2 Server: 100% H2Spec Compliant!

**A major milestone for the Crystal ecosystem**

---

## 🏆 What We've Achieved

We're excited to announce that **Duo**, our high-performance HTTP/2 server written in pure Crystal, has achieved **100% compliance** with the HTTP/2 specification (RFC 7540)!

### 📊 Test Results

```bash
h2spec -t -k -p 9876 -h localhost

Finished in 1.9893 seconds
146 tests, 146 passed, 0 skipped, 0 failed
```

**All 146 H2Spec tests pass** ✅ - covering everything from connection management to flow control, header compression, and error handling.

---

## 🚀 Why This Matters for Crystal

This is a significant achievement for the Crystal ecosystem because:

- **First fully compliant HTTP/2 server** written in pure Crystal
- **Zero external dependencies** - everything is implemented in Crystal
- **Production-ready performance** - 10,900+ req/s burst, 3,600+ req/s sustained
- **Memory safety** - Leverages Crystal's compile-time guarantees
- **Developer experience** - Clean, idiomatic Crystal APIs

---

## 🎯 Key Features

- 🔥 **Full HTTP/2 Compliance** - All 146 H2Spec tests pass
- ⚡ **High Performance** - 10,900+ req/s burst, 3,600+ req/s sustained
- 🔒 **TLS by Default** - Built-in SSL/TLS support with ALPN
- 🧩 **Modular Design** - Clean handler-based architecture
- 📦 **Zero Dependencies** - Pure Crystal implementation
- 🌐 **HTTP/1.1 Fallback** - Automatic protocol negotiation
- 🛡️ **Production Ready** - Robust error handling and connection management

## 🚀 Get Started in 5 Minutes

### 1. Add to Your Project

```yaml
# shard.yml
dependencies:
  duo:
    github: azutoolkit/duo
```

```bash
shards install
```

### 2. Hello World Server

```crystal
require "duo"

class HelloHandler
  include Duo::Server::Handler

  def call(context : Duo::Server::Context)
    context.response << "Hello, HTTP/2 World! 🚀"
    context
  end
end

# Create SSL context (required for HTTP/2)
ssl_context = OpenSSL::SSL::Context::Server.new
ssl_context.certificate_chain = "cert.pem"
ssl_context.private_key = "key.pem"
ssl_context.alpn_protocol = "h2"

# Start the server
server = Duo::Server.new("::", 9876, ssl_context)
server.listen([HelloHandler.new])
```

### 3. Test It

```bash
# Run the server
crystal run examples/server.cr

# Test with curl
curl -k https://localhost:9876/

# Run H2Spec compliance tests
h2spec -t -k -p 9876 -h localhost

# Performance benchmark
h2load -n 10000 -c 100 https://localhost:9876/
```

---

## 🧪 Try the Examples

We've included comprehensive examples to help you explore HTTP/2 features:

### JSON API Server

```bash
# See examples/server.cr for a full JSON API implementation
curl -k https://localhost:9876/api/users
```

### HTTP/2 Client

```crystal
require "duo/client"

client = Duo::Client.new("httpbin.org", 443, tls: true)

# Make concurrent requests
10.times do |i|
  headers = HTTP::Headers{
    ":method" => "GET",
    ":path" => "/json",
    "user-agent" => "duo-client/1.0"
  }

  client.request(headers) do |response_headers, body|
    puts "Response #{i}: #{response_headers[":status"]}"
  end
end
```

### Static File Server

```crystal
class StaticFileHandler
  include Duo::Server::Handler

  def call(context : Duo::Server::Context)
    # Handle static files with caching headers
    # See examples for full implementation
  end
end
```

---

## 🔧 Development & Testing

### Run the Test Suite

```bash
# Crystal specs
crystal spec

# HTTP/2 compliance tests
h2spec -t -k -p 9876 -h localhost

# Performance benchmarks
h2load -n 100000 -c 1000 -m 10 https://localhost:9876/health
```

### Development Workflow

```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/azutoolkit/duo.git
cd duo
shards install

# Run examples
crystal run examples/server.cr

# Build test server
crystal build examples/server.cr -o test_server
./test_server
```
